Prettify_craigslist
===================

An open source Chrome extension that makes Craigslist look nice.


##What if Craigslist was popular and also...

responsive, typographic, grid-based, had clear visual hierarchies, and a reasonable amount of whitespace? Prettify Craigslist is an attempt to answer that question. 

This treatment makes heavy use of [Cabin](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cabin), developed by Pablo Impallari and avaiable through Google Fonts. Cabin is a Humanist Sans, with a touch of modernism. 

Other people this extension is indebted to include Graphic Designer Mike Gangwere, for supplying the sharp, clean logo, and Alex Wolkov, for creating Extensionizr, which enabled me to start building this extension easily.

So far, my approach has been to use pure CSS to reflow the content. There is a lot of work that could be done. Here are some way to contribute/things that I would like to do in the future:

 - Cleaning up the CSS
 
 - Add more attractive buttons, dropdowns and text fields. I have included jQuery in the extension, even though I don't use it yet. I would like the elements to be the style of Boostrap 3, or Flat UI.
 
- Add an options page that allows people to customize the fonts/colors. Or create their own themes.
 
 Also, feel free to fork this project and use it as a basis for a different approach.
