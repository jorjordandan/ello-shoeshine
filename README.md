Ello Shoeshine
===================

An open source Chrome extension that changes the font on ello.




This treatment makes heavy use of [Muli](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Muli), available through Google Fonts. 


So far, my approach has been to use pure CSS to reflow the content. There is a lot of work that could be done. 
 
 Also, feel free to fork this project and use it as a basis for a different approach.
